*** Theory ***
[x] Figure out tagging hierarchy. What is the schema here? 
- Weekly cost reduction update
- Lambda to autotag resources on creation
- Tag ebs volumes based on the ec2 instance they're attached to
- Elastic search autoscaling? Spotinst?
- Remove unattached EBS volume after 3 notifications and x days
- Remove unused EBS snapshots


*** General ***
	- Remove unused elastic ips

*** Solr ***
	1. Scale down clusters if possible
	2. Resize instances
	3. i-0095456c83c3a3ed3 is possibly unused. [Stopped]
	4. Put tagging on all the resources Solr is using - ELBs, EC2, S3, Lambda
	5. Move Solr disks to gp2 and clean up any disks that might be being used
	6. Put cost tags on solr (terraform launch template and master. Manually on others)

*** Sweep elasticache  ***
	1. Checkout elasticache in runnr account
		shrink prod-carthero instance size
	2. Remove one more shard from production-o2 tonight
	3. zanalytics-clustered - remove one shard and one replica
	4. nps - Remove replica?


*** Sweep RDS ***
	1. Create a planned event for known rds instances on the zomato account with the cost benefits of each action. Also mention the daily burn per account
	[x] SMS aurora deletion
	3. Runnr RDS 
		readreplicavpcprodstats1 used?
		readreplicavpcprodstats used?
		rdsvpcprodstats-analytics used?
		restored-2020-02-20-20-00-26 delete after use. This is on for the entire day
		notificationservice downsize
	4. Downsize prod-infinityservice-cluster as not being used. Then give the infinity team a deadline post which you can remove the instance. Also need to take a backup
	5. Delete prod-chatbackend-service-cluster-instance-2 and aurora-zomato-chat-reader
	6. Downsize https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=ap-southeast-1#database:id=userservicedb-instance-1;is-cluster=false;tab=monitoring
	7. Delete one read replica in aurora-zomatogolddb cluster
	8. Downsize Videoservice RDS (Unused reader. Can we downsize to t2?)



*** Sweep cassandra *** 
1. Reduce iops
2. Reduce ebs volumes 
3. move to gp2 from io1

Task 1:
	check the current iops over 7 days, scale it down according to 70% utilization, 
	if iops limit is < 3x of the disk then move to gp2

Task 2:
	check the instance size cpu utilization if <30% then scale it down

- Change disk type to gp2 on old cassandra cluster
- Reduce PIOPS on profile store cassndra
- Add cost allocation tags to cassandra clusters
- evaluate the scaledown parameters based on last 2 months data
- evaluate the optimizations that can be done
- Reduce nodes from old cassandra cluster


*** Observability ***
- Move to spotinst
- Autoscaling policy. Shut down at night time?

*** Ideas ***
Terminate stopped ec2 instances

Not all resources support tags. For a list of resources that can be tagged, see User-Defined Cost Allocation Tags.
https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html
Also in the Console -> billing and cost console -> navigation -> cost allocation tags -> Refresh. Try that it may jump start them.

*** EC2 clean up *** 

Unknown ec2 instances 
	kfnode3?
	gunjan - httpbin
	auth.zomato.com
	ApacheCanary?

[x] Delete ec2 instance Solr_Cluster_2_v2
