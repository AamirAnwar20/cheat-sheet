The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance
Your DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases
Each DB instance runs a DB engine
The computation and memory capacity of a DB instance is determined by its DB instance class.
DB instance storage comes in three types: Magnetic, General Purpose (SSD), and Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS). 
You can run your DB instance in several Availability Zones, an option called a Multi-AZ deployment.
Amazon RDS uses Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize the time on DB Instances.
